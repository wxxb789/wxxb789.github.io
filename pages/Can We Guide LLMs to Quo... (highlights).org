** Can we guide LLMs to quote text from their pre-training data using prefixes like "According To ..", improving grounding and reducing hallucination? We discovered that LLMs do have this capability and can increase or decrease quoting on request ü§Ø

** A challenge here is efficiently and scalably measuring an LLM's grounding (i.e., quoting from) in pre-training data. To tackle this, we present a new metric (QUIP-score) based on Data Portraits üñºÔ∏è, which evaluates the direct presence of LLM-generations in a given corpus. 2/5 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/orionweller/status/1660994245686366219))
** Excitingly, our experiments show that these "According To" prompts aimed at grounding LLMs significantly improve grounding under our metric (while anti-grounding prompts lower the score). Not only that, but According To prompts often improves the downstream task performance! 3/5

** We also conduct scaling experiments with LLMs of different sizes. As the model size grows, their capacity to quote from pre-training increases (on both OpenAI and open-sourced models).
