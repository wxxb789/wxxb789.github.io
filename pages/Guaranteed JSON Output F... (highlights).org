"The basic idea is simple: regular expressions have an equivalent Deterministic-Finite Automaton (DFA) representation. We can transform this DFA into a generative model: in each state we get a list of symbols which correspond to completions that partially match the regular expression. We mask the other symbols in the logits returned by a large language model, sample a new symbol and move to the next state." - @remilouf and co at @normalcomputing  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sergeykarayev/status/1691173819422257152))
