Anthropic (Claude) has a really neat tool on their website.

It's a prompt optimizer and can turn a simple prompt into an advanced prompt template.

I've tested it and it works incredibly well.

Here's how to use it (in 3 steps):

A couple of notes to start:

\- This prompt optimizer differs from others optimizers in that it's great for creating prompt TEMPLATES, i.e. prompts that allow you to fill in more context
- To use it you'll need an API key, but you can get some free credits

2/ Enter prompt

In step 4 you'll be able to enter your initial prompt.

We'll use: "Design a marketing strategy for launching a new product"

You can enter variables too or leave it empty and to let Claude come up with them for you
