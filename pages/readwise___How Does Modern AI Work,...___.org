How does modern AI work, what is its history, and how does it compare with human intelligence?  My book gives an in-depth, accessible guide for lay people & experts alike.  

Coming in 2023: new chapters on transformers, generative AI, and AI "alignment".

Not a new edition but I will likely just put new chapters on my website.  Stay tuned!
