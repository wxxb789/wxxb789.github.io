1/ I’ll be attending #ICML & presenting my poster on memorization + unlearning in fine-tuned LLMs on July 29th at the GenLaw workshop (https://t.co/UrUBD8G9yn). 

Please reach out if you’d like to talk memorization, hangout 🌴🍹, or have any advice for a first-timer :)

2/ Paper: https://t.co/AYqyhMHoIw

The main takeaways are: 1) Unlearning highly vulnerable points from training data can put the remaining points at risk of extraction.

3/ 2) Fine-tuned models can still leak the training data memorized during the pre-training phase. We prompt GPT-2 L fine-tuned on WikiText-103 with a few tokens from Common Crawl and it leaked stuff that didn't belong to fine-tuning set (like phone no, URLs, PMID, tracking no)

4/ This poster is inspired by and builds on some of the previous works on memorization such as: https://t.co/u7BFMCyZjk and https://t.co/FF52bMvOFg.

5/ These are still very preliminary results and I’d love to discuss more at the conference/workshop and get some feedback from both CS and Law folks :)

and super excited to meet old and new friends!!!
