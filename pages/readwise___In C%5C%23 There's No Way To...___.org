In C# there's no way to truly isolate code outside of projects/assemblies. This causes a proliferation of projects in repositories because it's the only easy way to ensure that layering is correct between different components.

I wonder if we introduced some other concept at the language level if we'd still see as many projects...

#dotnet #csharp

There are legitimate reasons to split things up:
1. Ability to isolate dependencies like NuGet packages.
2. Distribution (publishing a package). 
3. Ability to version components independently.
4. Sharing common code across a code base or solution (s).

Maybe top-level private classes within namespaces is enough. [jaredpar](https://twitter.com/jaredpar)  is that what you were saying?
