#+title: pl/csharp/Concurrency/ThreadStatic

* Compare =ThreadStatic= with =ThreadLocal<T>=
** =ThreadStatic=
*** non generic, =static= is required
*** dose not initialize all things for every thread
(btw, it will be initialized if in first thread, but subsequent not)
*** works with ~.net 3.5~ and below
*** [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threadstaticattribute][ThreadStaticAttribute Class]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
^^Remarks^^:
Do not specify initial values for fields marked with ThreadStaticAttribute
#+END_QUOTE
*** don't have to change existing references you already have
** =ThreadLocal<T>=
*** generic
*** support =Func= for initialization
*** works for ~.net 4~ and above
*** support =IDisposable= and force you to implement it
*** =ThreadLocal<T>= is based on =ThreadStatic=
[[https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/ThreadLocal.cs][ThreadLocal<T> source]]
* Both works well with threads pool pattern.
