[1/4] Introducing HyDE, a method to unsupervisedly build dense retrievers. HyDE zero-shot instructs GPT to generate a fictional document and re-encodes it with Contriever to search in its embedding space. Put it simply, casting retrieval-like behavior in GPT into real retrieval.

[2/4] With zero training/fine-tuning, HyDE significantly outperforms its backbone Contriever across tasks and languages. On several query sets, it even shows better performance than strong fine-tuned models.

[3/4] One of the most interesting problems we encountered while working on this was: if strong generative models can largely improve sole retriever’s performance, should we shift the responsibility of high precision away from the retriever.
