🤖️LLM can self-improve 🧠

1) Self-consistency boosts reasoning skills by sampling multiple paths & finding the most consistent answer

But more samples = more comp. requirements. 💻

2)  but we can train better LLM with self-generated solutions from 1)

\- dataset of unlabeled questions
- few-shot chain of thought prompts to generate the "pseudo" labels for the self-train pass

Authors show one can also extend a dataset with synthetic questions, to get more pseudo labels, and improve results further
