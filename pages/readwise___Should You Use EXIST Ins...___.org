Should you use EXIST instead of IN?

Better performances? ðŸ¤” 

To compare, it's important to understand how each of them works and the context in which they are executed. 

IN:

â€¢ The Query selects all customers whose customer_id is in the list produced by the subquery.
â€¢ The Subquery generates a list of customer_ids from the orders table for orders placed in the last 30 days.
â€¢ The main query then does a lookup for each customer_id in this list against the customers table.

EXIST:

â€¢ The query selects customers where there exists at least one record in the orders table that meets the criteria.
â€¢ The EXISTS clause checks for the presence of a matching record, rather than retrieving a list of customer_ids.
â€¢ The subquery is correlated with the outer query (o.customer_id = c.customer_id), meaning it needs to be evaluated for each row in the customers table.

Performance Comparison:

1. Subquery Evaluation: 

â€¢ The IN clause uses a subquery that is executed once, creating a list of customer_ids. 
â€¢ The EXISTS clause's subquery is a correlated subquery and may need to be evaluated for each row in the customers table, potentially leading to more computations.

2. Index Usage: 

â€¢ If there are indexes on customer_id in both the customers and orders tables, the IN query might perform better as it can quickly lookup the customer_ids in the customers table. 
â€¢ The performance of the EXISTS query also depends on indexing but can be slower due to repeated evaluations of the subquery.

3. Result Set Size: 

â€¢ If the subquery in the IN clause returns a large set of customer_ids, the IN clause might become less efficient. 
â€¢ In such cases, EXISTS could be more efficient as it stops evaluating as soon as a match is found.
