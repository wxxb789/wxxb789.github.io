Just made a Terminal plugin for Obsidian @obsdmd 

Obsidian is an excellent tool for PKM / Personal Knowledge Management using strategies such as PARA / Building a Second Brain by @fortelabs and Zettelkasten

Plan to use it to open the current note in Neovim :D

Now BRAT-compatible, so rather than installing it manually from Github you can simply install Obsidian42 BRAT plugin by @TfTHacker from the existing community plugins and then choose "Add Beta plugin" via BRAT and enter "clevcode/obsidian-terminal-plugin"
