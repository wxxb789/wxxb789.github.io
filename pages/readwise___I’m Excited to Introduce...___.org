I‚Äôm excited to introduce RAGs - create a ‚ÄúChatGPT over your data‚Äù purely with natural language üí¨

Setup and use a full RAG pipeline over files/web urls in three simple steps:
1Ô∏è‚É£ RAG Builder: Describe your RAG pipeline in natural language (data, parameters like top-k, system prompt), and let the builder agent build this for you.
2Ô∏è‚É£ View Config: View the generated RAG configuration and make edits to it if you want to update the agent.
3Ô∏è‚É£ RAG Agent: Ask the agent anything and it‚Äôll answer the question!

Of course, this is heavily inspired by GPTs from <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI">@OpenAI</a>. The goal here was to build a similar natural language interface but tailored around RAG - retrieval parameters, prompts, data sources, all through conversation. Have an agent help you setup QA over your data instead of you writing code.

We built the app with <a href="https://twitter.com/llama_index">@llama_index</a> + <a href="https://twitter.com/streamlit">@streamlit</a>. It currently supports the following: 
\- LLMs: Supports our 20+ LLMs for builder agent (uses OpenAI by default) and currently supports OpenAI for generated agent (not too hard to extend).
- Embeddings: Supports OpenAI ada embeddings and <a href="https://twitter.com/huggingface">@huggingface</a> models.

There‚Äôs so many things we want to do. In the meantime if you have feedback/suggestions let us know!

Check out the attached video, blog post, and repo.
