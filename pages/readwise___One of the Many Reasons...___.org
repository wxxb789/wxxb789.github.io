By 2022, Iâ€™ve written 10+ R packages. 

Timetk, tidyquant & modeltime alone have 2,500,000+ downloads.

People see me now and think my success with R happened overnight. 

It didnâ€™t.

I actually started my data science journey in Python.

It was miserable.

I was coming from an Excel background.

3 months in I quit.

I remember thinking, if this is what data science is like, then I donâ€™t think I can do this.

Python was too much like coding.

I was trapped in classes, methods & object-oriented programming.

And I quit.

But then something happened.

A friend of mine recommended that I give R a try.

That was the day things changed.

Within a week I had become obsessed with R.

It still wasnâ€™t easy but I could do things like basic data analysis, linear regression, and I could make (crappy) plots.

Â I was learning. And it felt good.

Things started to pick up.

My confidence grew.

And I kept going.

Over the course of the next 2 years, I received 3 job promotions.

I went from managing a team of 4 (including me) to managing 60+ people.

My salary doubled.

And it was largely due to R.

The tools gave me so much power.

I eventually found my passion for teaching.

And I made a career shift. To helping others.

Which is why I want to share something with you.

If you are feeling lost trying to figure out things for yourself, then Iâ€™d like to help.

I have a 40-minute webinar on the 10 skills that helped me become a data scientist using R.

Enjoy!
