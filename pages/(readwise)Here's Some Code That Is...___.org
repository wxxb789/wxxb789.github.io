Here's some code that is on the hot path on your application and you want to optimize it. This is what a typical C# developer would write (actually copilot wrote this). It's pretty clear, but suboptimal. How could you go about improving it? #dotnet #csharp

There are lots of allocations here:
1. The string[] splitting up query string parts by &
2. Each key value pair string[] splitting each part by =
3. The List<string> of new results
4. The final string

One more assumption you can make: The instanceId will only occur once or 0 times in the input querystring.

I think most people would start with this code a single LINQ statement ðŸ˜Š.

There are some trends in the replies. The most efficient solutions really require re-thinking the problem and constraints. This is why performance work is difficult and not a one size fits all solution. Do you optimize the current code? Or do you change the approach?

Here's the allocation profile for 100,000 calls to this method:

I think most of the answers landed on 2 approaches:
1. Optimize the current code using Spans, stack alloc and various other approaches to reduce the overhead and intermediate allocations.
2. Find the "instanceId=" inside of the query string and remove it.

I ended up with number 2 as well, but I think it's worth discussing 1 more as an exploration of new APIs, options and tradeoffs.

So, if we assume the existing pattern:
1. Split up the query string into parts
2. Find the relevant key value pair with the "instanceId" key.
3. Build a new string without that pair.

Let's look at each problem separately.

Splitting the query string into parts. Any good 20+ year old framework has multiple ways of doing things:
1. https://t.co/xePqkuf8VU
2. https://t.co/0BDOvCcmkI

These both allocate collections that represent the decoded query string values.

We recently added https://t.co/Pm34xTsPhU to allow allocation free enumeration of these values.

You can also use the StringTokenizer to do allocation free splitting based on a separator https://t.co/n2QtKmWYFr

There's also a new Split method (https://t.co/5Aj1HZUept) for Spans that works well if you know the maximum number of segments after splitting:

When you don't know the segments in advance, you can do a pass to figure that out with MemoryExtensions.Count. https://t.co/skknMjzRf2
It's extremely optimized (vectorization etc etc).
