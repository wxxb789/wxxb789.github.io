10 points you must know about Load Balancers.

[1] A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.

[2] We need load balancers for two things - workload distribution and redundancy

[3] There are two main types of load balancers - Layer 4 and Layer 7

[4] Layer 4 LBs operate in the transport layer of the OSI model. Examples include HAProxy, AWS Network Load Balancer, Azure Load Balancer

[5] Layer 7 LBs operate in the application layer. Examples include HAProxy, Nginx, AWS Application Load Balancer, Azure Application Gateway

[6] There are two main categories of load-balancing algorithms - static and dynamic.

[7] Static LB algorithms include round-robin, sticky round-robin, weighted round-robin, and hash-based

[8] Dynamic LB algorithms include the least connections and least response time

[9] Can load balancers become a single point of failure? Not really because most cloud load balancers are configured for high availability. 

[10] However, you can also build a high-availability load balancer with an active-passive or active-active configuration.

Do you want to learn more about load balancers?ðŸ‘‡
