#fsharp Adaptive Data can be integrated very easily with Avalonia's binding mechanisms via the IBinding interface, so you can have one-way adaptive values and two way binding for changeable values (useful for textbox controls), I find hard to not fanboy for avalonia

It plays excellently well with F# in all of it's presentations, from the most functional side (FuncUI) to the most Avalonia'ish way to do things (Plain F# + XAML + MVVM) or even in-between (NXUI) it is such a really good piece of software
