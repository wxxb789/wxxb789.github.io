Now, if you want to copy the location of an item, you don't necessarily need to do it manually. There is a solution for that too.

First, make sure you have Xclip installed.

    sudo apt install xclip

Now pipe it to xclip like this:

    fzf | xclip -selection clipboard

This will copy whatever lines you have pressed the enter key, on to your clipboard.

Another choice: Fzy, the Fuzzy Selector

Unlike `fzf`, `fzy` is a fuzzy selector, where you will be provided a menu to select, depending on the input.
