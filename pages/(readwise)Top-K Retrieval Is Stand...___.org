Top-k retrieval is standard in LLM RAG systems - but it may miss important context ‚ö†Ô∏è

You can augment top-k by exploiting relationships in knowledge graphs to fetch additional context üí°‚ú®

We have an new guide on this (s/o @wey_gu)! https://t.co/ZJb02TORFX

In this guide, we show you how to build a custom retriever that combines vector similarity search with knowledge graphs.

We construct a vector index and KG index.

During query-time, we execute retrieval independently, and combine the results.

In some cases, combining the two shows an improvement in results! Adding on KG retrieval helps to fetch additional context for entities that would otherwise not be returned through pure similarity search.

In this example, we ask about NASA üî≠

Limitation: Combining both retrieval methods does lead to a slight increase in latency (~7%). 

Of course, there can be many other ways to combine similarity search with KG retrieval, this is just one step. HUGE shoutout to @wey_gu for the thought leadership in this area üéâ
