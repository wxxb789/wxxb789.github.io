Just finished watching [mbpmilano](https://twitter.com/mbpmilano)'s talk on programming distributed systems. Some very interesting work on the intersection of programming languages and distributed systems. She gave overview of 3 of her papers and connected them super smoothly.

First section was around solving the problem of consistency in a distributed system using an embedded language.

The 2nd part was around leveraging monotonicity to do fast state-machine replication

The final part was the most interesting to me. She talked about a new type system to provide fearless concurrency. Rust kind of does it but it limits you in case of cycling data structures. However, they propose a clean solution to that problem as well.
