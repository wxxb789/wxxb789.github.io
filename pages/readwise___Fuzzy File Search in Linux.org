Using `fzf` with `tree` command can help you find the absolute path of a particular file.

Now, if you want to copy the location of an item, you don't necessarily need to do it manually. There is a solution for that too.

First, make sure you have Xclip installed.

    sudo apt install xclip

Now pipe it to xclip like this:

    fzf | xclip -selection clipboard

This will copy whatever lines you have pressed the enter key, on to your clipboard.

â€¢   `cat ~/.bashrc | fzf` - Search Inside Bashrc
â€¢   `lsblk | fzf` - Search inside the list of lock devices
â€¢   `ps -aux | fzf` - Search inside process list

Another choice: Fzy, the Fuzzy Selector

Unlike `fzf`, `fzy` is a fuzzy selector, where you will be provided a menu to select, depending on the input.
