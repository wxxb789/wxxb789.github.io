Let me show something that is ACTUALLY DIFFERENT. [perplexity_ai](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai)  is NOT ABLE TO deal with new arxiv papers while our chrome extension, https://t.co/5clMuIOv4a, does an excellent job. See this thread for details.

Proof in this thread. You are welcome to check it out.

Dude, this is so old. Stop wrongfully accuse others of copying. Like, it's a search interface, what would be different anyway?

This time, please, please don't say we are copying [perplexity_ai](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai) . Or, we welcome perplexity to borrow our idea - I promise I won't exploit such opportunity for publicity.

[perplexity_ai](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai) Screenshot: perplexity failing to understand the content. It's only able to capture the title.

[perplexity_ai](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai) And here is elmo chat: Structured, clean output of the summary, abstract and key bullet points of the paper. The model behind it is mixtral 8x7b (from [MistralAI](https://twitter.com/MistralAI) who I respect immensively). Mixtral 8x22b is being tested.

We strongly believe that personal AI assistants like https://t.co/2X36snScrq should be offered free from the influence of advertising-driven models. This being said, we don't intend to disrupt anyone, we just want your life to be easier.

Taking the screenshots also made me realize I have to upgrade Chrome yet again.
