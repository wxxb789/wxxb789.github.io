How do I pick which paper to read?
 
I seek recommendations from experts or individuals who frequently engage in reading. e.g. When I joined the SimpleDB team in 2011, I asked @somu_peri  for suggestions on which papers to read before starting on the team.

Other approaches I follow to generate a list of papers to read:
 
1/ Look at citations in papers I am currently reading,
 
2/ Review the list of  accepted papers at conferences (OSDI, NSDI, USENIX ATC, FAST, VLDB), and
 
3/ Keep track of relevant blogs

The first pass is a rapid overview of the paper, in which I gain a broad understanding by reading the title, abstract, and introduction, as well as the conclusions.
 
I also scan the section and subsection headings, but not concern myself with the details at this stage.

Upon completing the initial pass, I have a high level understanding of the paper's type, any similar papers I have read in the past, main contributions of the paper, and overall quality of the work. This also allows me to contextualize the paper & assess its value to my interests

During the second pass, I begin by searching for the paper online. If the paper was presented at a conference, I may be able to find a video by one of the authors. By watching this video, I gain a better understanding of the key points being emphasized by the presenter.

After the first or second pass, I often discard most of the papers that I have read. Various reasons for discarding include  insufficient knowledge of the subject matter, unfavorable impression of the paper.
 
Time is currency and it is important to be selective.

During the third pass, I carefully read the details in the sections after the introduction and make note of key points that stand out to me, whether positively or negatively. After completing this thorough reading, I should be able to summarize the paper.

The third pass is similar to performing code/design reviews for my peers, where I effectively rewrite the code on a piece of paper to fully comprehend the choices made, alternative options that could have been considered, and potential pitfalls.
