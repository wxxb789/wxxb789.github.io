Start-up life = hard won insights. Here are my top 10 for this year.

8.  Being "successful" in a particular role at a particular company in a particular chapter of your life is not a reflection of your worth as a person.

9. The price of rapid improvement is repeated failure. Doubt and discomfort are the entry price of excellence.

It's your choice to play this game, of course. But if you do, recognize that there are no shortcuts to hard work and struggle.
