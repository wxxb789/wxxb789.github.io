** By 2022, I’ve written 10+ R packages. 

Timetk, tidyquant & modeltime alone have 2,500,000+ downloads.

People see me now and think my success with R happened overnight. 

It didn’t.  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1687798319131586560))

** I actually started my data science journey in Python.

It was miserable.

I was coming from an Excel background.

3 months in I quit.  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1687798320431808513))

** I remember thinking, if this is what data science is like, then I don’t think I can do this.

Python was too much like coding.

I was trapped in classes, methods & object-oriented programming.

And I quit.  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1687798321702731776))

** But then something happened.

A friend of mine recommended that I give R a try.

That was the day things changed.

Within a week I had become obsessed with R.  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1687798323179032576))

** It still wasn’t easy but I could do things like basic data analysis, linear regression, and I could make (crappy) plots.

 I was learning. And it felt good.

Things started to pick up.

My confidence grew.

And I kept going.  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1687798324475158528))

** Over the course of the next 2 years, I received 3 job promotions.

I went from managing a team of 4 (including me) to managing 60+ people.

My salary doubled.

And it was largely due to R.

The tools gave me so much power.  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1687798325787967488))

** I eventually found my passion for teaching.

And I made a career shift. To helping others.

Which is why I want to share something with you.  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/1687798327344025600))

** If you are feeling lost trying to figure out things for yourself, then I’d like to help.

I have a 40-minute webinar on the 10 skills that helped me become a data scientist using R.

Enjoy!
