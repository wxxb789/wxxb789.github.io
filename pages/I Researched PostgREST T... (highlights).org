** I researched PostgREST today.

It's a RESTful API on top of PostgreSQL.

Here are 4 lessons I learned in 20 minutes:

1. You get a CRUD API in minutes
2. Great performance
3. Has a C# client
4. Good option for a Blazor backend

Hope that's helpful. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mjovanovictech/status/1638147600535678978))
