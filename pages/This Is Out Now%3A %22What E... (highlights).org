** This is out now: "What Every Developer Should Know About GPU Computing" 
https://t.co/9xQibwqEoG

It took longer than anticipated but good things usually do take time. Big thanks to @msharmavikram for reviews and suggestions, his feedback added another level of depth.

GPUs are a very different beast, and as an outsider you will encounter a ton of new terms and concepts you have never heard about. This article won't make you an expert because for that you need to read a whole book or take a course on this topic. However, if you wanted to learn how do GPUs work and what distinguishes them from CPUs, then this article is for you.

Here's what you will learn:
\- A high level comparison between CPU and GPU architectures
- A deeper look at the GPU compute and memory architecture
- How a kernel executes on the GPU
- Dynamic resource partitioning and Occupancy

I hope you enjoy it. I will try to share a summary here later.  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/abhi9u/status/1714669373288567233))
