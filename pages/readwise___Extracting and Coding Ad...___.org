Extracting and coding adverse drug reactions in biomedical literature is vital for drug safety, but not easy to automate. 

This DSPy program combines in-context learning and retrieval to set SOTA on BioDEX (~35% Recall@10), using ~100 samples.

Previous fine-tuned and in-context attempts struggled on BioDEX because of long contexts, the biomedical domain, and extreme classification (~26k classes).

Combining grounding and in-context learning is a great first step, but many pipelines are possible!

Crucially, we apply discrete prompt optimization to the in-context module, with the grounding in-the-loop. 

No human-expert prompting work required! 

Easy, intuitive, reproducible, and modular; this is how in-context learning should be done.
