Did you know #Python has a built-in way to chain multiple dictionaries together?

It's called `ChainMap` and it's part of the `collections` module.

Let's talk a little about it today!

A ChainMap takes one or more mappings or dictionaries and combines them into a single unit.

When you do this, the ChainMap will go through each map in order to see if that key exists and has a value. If it does, then the ChainMap will return the first value it finds. 🐍🔥

Here's another example where you create a ChainMap that looks at the following mappings:

🐍  Command line arguments
🐍  Environment variables
🐍  A default mapping

This allows the user to override settings on the command line or fall back to env vars or the defaults
