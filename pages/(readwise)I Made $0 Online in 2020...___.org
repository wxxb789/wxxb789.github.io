But 2 years later:

\- 400K+ social media followers
- $300K+ online income

Here are my 6 simple steps on getting started:

1, Find your community

When I became passionate about Notion, the first step I took was finding the Notion community.

\- Reddit subreddit
- Facebook groups
- Discord community

I build my initial online presence by participating in daily conversations.

2. Grow your audience on social media

Community groups can be restrictive.

Build a larger, trusted audience on social media by studying successful accounts in your niche.

If you can't manage multiple accounts, focus on one.

If you can, repurpose your content.

3. Create a high-value free offer

You lack credibility when you don't have an audience.

To lower the barrier of entry, put in a lot of work for your first offer and make it free,

This is how you build a loyal customer base that trusts and believes in your work.

4. Leverage your network
 
Connecting and collaborating with like-minded people can open up new opportunities.

You gain exposure to people you might not have reached on your own.

Cold DM people who are two steps ahead of you in your niche.

I regret not doing this more.

5. Leverage modern tools

Adaptability and the ability to learn new skills are crucial for success.

Don't be afraid to try out new tools and technologies, especially AI and no-code tools.

Keep learning and growing.

6. Build your systems

Invest in building systems to save time and streamline your work.

This can be a content creation system, knowledge management system, personal CRM, or any tried and tested processes.

Notion is a great all-in-one workspace for this.
