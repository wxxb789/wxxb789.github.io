** Why I read technical papers?
 
I read technical papers to gain insights that can be applied to my work & to deepen my understanding of subject that piques my curiosity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688149107253259))
** How do I pick which paper to read?
 
I seek recommendations from experts or individuals who frequently engage in reading. e.g. When I joined the SimpleDB team in 2011, I asked @somu_peri  for suggestions on which papers to read before starting on the team. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688152525623296))
** Other approaches I follow to generate a list of papers to read:
 
1/ Look at citations in papers I am currently reading,
 
2/ Review the list of  accepted papers at conferences (OSDI, NSDI, USENIX ATC, FAST, VLDB), and
 
3/ Keep track of relevant blogs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688154744246272))
** How I read a paper?
 
1/ I do a fast initial pass,
 
2/ Search for supplementary materials such as YouTube videos or blog posts,
 
3/ A thorough read-through of the paper to maximize my understanding and retention of the ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688157994983424))
** The first pass is a rapid overview of the paper, in which I gain a broad understanding by reading the title, abstract, and introduction, as well as the conclusions.
 
I also scan the section and subsection headings, but not concern myself with the details at this stage. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688160373313536))
** Upon completing the initial pass, I have a high level understanding of the paper's type, any similar papers I have read in the past, main contributions of the paper, and overall quality of the work. This also allows me to contextualize the paper & assess its value to my interests ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688163032244225))
** During the second pass, I begin by searching for the paper online. If the paper was presented at a conference, I may be able to find a video by one of the authors. By watching this video, I gain a better understanding of the key points being emphasized by the presenter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688166933045267))
** After the first or second pass, I often discard most of the papers that I have read. Various reasons for discarding include  insufficient knowledge of the subject matter, unfavorable impression of the paper.
 
Time is currency and it is important to be selective. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688170225483778))
** During the third pass, I carefully read the details in the sections after the introduction and make note of key points that stand out to me, whether positively or negatively. After completing this thorough reading, I should be able to summarize the paper. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688174742642688))
** The third pass is similar to performing code/design reviews for my peers, where I effectively rewrite the code on a piece of paper to fully comprehend the choices made, alternative options that could have been considered, and potential pitfalls.

** Blogs I follow https://t.co/kvATbk1ki9 https://t.co/Il4HaoLQLY  and similar ideas presented in this paper on how to read a paper https://t.co/QDvhaetGF1 

Please share your thoughts if you follow a different approach, I am interested in learning alternate strategies. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688178907586560))
** An example of a paper that I read and found helpful for gaining a deeper understanding of distributed transactions is - Timestamp based ordering for concurrency control where serialization order is selected a priori & without clock synchronization https://t.co/nyj6m78AJU ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/akshatvig/status/1605688180724076544))
