** This @rustlang tool is part of my work @GoogleHealth‚Äôs genomics team (hosts: @daniel_e_cook and @belyaeva_ana). We use it for evaluating DeepConsensus, though it should be generally useful for evaluating basecalling or other sequencing methods

** There are many tools for quality control of sequencing data, but many of them are not suitable for evaluating sequencing accuracy when a ‚Äútruth‚Äù reference assembly is available. This tool takes in aligned reads and computes many metrics like yield, homopolymer accuracy, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/daniel_c0deb0t/status/1606385591234760704))
** It outputs csv files that are easily usable for downstream analysis, comparison of techniques, plotting, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/daniel_c0deb0t/status/1606385595646738432))
** Finally, I think it‚Äôs got the best name üòé (best stands for Bam Error Stats Tool) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/daniel_c0deb0t/status/1606385608636522496))
** For a bit of background, DeepConsensus (by the genomics team @Google) is a transformer model for error correction in @PacBio‚Äôs circular consensus sequencing. It is used in the Revio sequencing machine: https://t.co/0KmkmMUALf ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/daniel_c0deb0t/status/1606390962212769811))
