@solana @aeyakovenko Just a heads folks up, we're about to hit the limit on our OpenAI account. We've put in in a request to have it raised but it likely won't be granted today.  

If anyone can help us expedite this request, we'd really appreciate it!

@solana @aeyakovenko Our API limit has been reached. Our back up account has been activated but it only has access to gpt-3.5. 

Response quality will be downgraded for the time-being, check back soon! The answers are still pretty good tho.
