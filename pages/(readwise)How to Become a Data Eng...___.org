You can dig into some extra skill building (like airflow), but being privy to how these tools work is a good baseline.

Networking: 

\- Document your progress on Linkedin and Twitter

- Interact with other learners and people who already DE's

It's not guaranteed, but there are fair odds that your first job will come as a recommendation from someone you've networked with.

Job Search: 

\- AWS certs will help if you don't have professional experience with it

- Message hiring recruiters and engineers of hiring companies (don't just send your resume out into the job board void)

- Share your project(s) with your network to get recommendations
