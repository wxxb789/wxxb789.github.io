We asked MTurk workers to rate eight aspects of 500 "asking-for-help" questions from AskReddit, with a focus on personal assistant scenarios. These aspects included their preference for a detailed conversation w/ the answerer vs. just asking the question and waiting for replies.

We then categorized the questions into 27 domains. We found:
âœ…People are ok with some conversation when asking questions (all domains got a rating > 3 out of 5)
âœ…Domains with the highest "conversation" ratings are *highly social and personal*, e.g., mental health, life advice.

At the other end of the spectrum, we found:
âœ…Conversations are deemed less essential for many utilitarian questions, e.g., food, help finding things, or life hacks.
âœ…People prefer not to engage in conversations when asking about NSFW or sensitive subjects.
