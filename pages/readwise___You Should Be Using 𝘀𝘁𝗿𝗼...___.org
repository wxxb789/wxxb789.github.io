You should be using 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗹𝘆-𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀 with Minimal APIs, here's why 👇

Minimal APIs were added in .NET 6 to simplify building APIs.

The access point is the static `TypedResults` class.

It exposes methods for returning the response types you're probably familiar with, like:
\- Ok
- BadRequest
- NotFound

You can combine multiple result types.
