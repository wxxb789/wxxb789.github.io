The main goal of StackLlama is to serve as a tutorial and walkthrough on how to train models with RLHF and not primarily model performance.

That said the model is surprisingly comical at generating answers, e.g.: There is a llama in my garden. How can I get rid of it?

If you are interested in learning how to train models with RLHF read the blog and have a look at the code posted above.

We also release the adapter weights of the models: https://t.co/pxSMYuO9Ct

Keep in mind that this is a toy model and has limitations - see the model cards!
