Using in-memory databases for "integration" testing is a waste of time.

I've seen folks do this with the EF in-memory provider.

That's not even a real database.

So, what value can those "integration" tests have?
Zero, if you ask me.

Instead, spin up an actual database using Docker.

You can connect to this database from your tests.

And now you're writing proper integration tests.

This is even easier in .NET with the Testcontainers library.

Here's how to start working with Testcontainers: https://t.co/vijKp1nMeT
