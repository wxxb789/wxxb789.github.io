Building STORM with LangGraph

Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking (STORM) is a recent paper from [EchoShao8899](https://twitter.com/EchoShao8899) et al offering a new approach for generating entirely synthetic Wikipedia-style pages. 

The basic algorithm is as follows:
+ Create Wiki editor personas to ask questions about a user-provided topic
+ Create Experts aided by search to answer questions about a user-provided topic
+ Let the two converse, creating an information rich corpus of questions, answer, and references
+ Then, use this to flesh out a wiki outline in several stages of refinement.

In this video, we show how to implement these ideas using LangGraph from scratch.

In it, we create a well structured wiki focused on "Groq and the future of inference" in < 5 minutes.
