** 🚨 New Instruction Data Alert!   

We introduce 🌟CoT Collection🌟, an instruction dataset including 52 times more CoT rationales and 177 times more tasks compared to previously available CoT datasets.

** Recent works showed that CoT Fine-tuning enables smaller LMs to solve new novel tasks more effectively.

But, up to date, there exists only 9 CoT datasets available, which FLAN-T5 used for training, namely AQuA, Creak, ECQA, eSNLI, GSM8K, QASC, QED, SenseMaking and StrategyQA. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/seungonekim/status/1660972367546310658))
** To resolve this issue, we augment CoT rationales using LLMs. 

Using FLAN Collection as a source, we use ICL and make LLMs generate high quality CoT rationales across 1,060 NLP tasks.

** So how could one use this dataset? 

To explore the benefits of CoT fine-tuning on massive amount of instruction data, we continually train FLAN-T5 with CoT Collection, resulting in our model C2F2.

Then, we test our model in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

** On the Big Bench Hard (BBH) benchmark, we observe +4.34%, +2.44% improvement across 3B and 11B model scale, respectively.

Also, naively training T5 on CoT Collection works effectively, considering that CoT Collection is 8 times smaller than FLAN Collection!

** Also, we show that a C2F2 could adapt to new tasks with few instances. 

On a 64 shot setting, C2F2 + LoRA outperforms FLAN-T5 + Full fine-tuning by +2.97% and +2.37% across 4 legal & medical datasets while updating 2,352x fewer parameters.
