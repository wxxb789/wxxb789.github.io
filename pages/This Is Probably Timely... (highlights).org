** This is probably timely for the ChatGPT era-- Our #CHI2023 Late-Breaking-Work paper raises an interesting question:

Are conversations truly desired by users for every kind of question?

** We asked MTurk workers to rate eight aspects of 500 "asking-for-help" questions from AskReddit, with a focus on personal assistant scenarios. These aspects included their preference for a detailed conversation w/ the answerer vs. just asking the question and waiting for replies.

** We then categorized the questions into 27 domains. We found:
✅People are ok with some conversation when asking questions (all domains got a rating > 3 out of 5)
✅Domains with the highest "conversation" ratings are *highly social and personal*, e.g., mental health, life advice.

** At the other end of the spectrum, we found:
✅Conversations are deemed less essential for many utilitarian questions, e.g., food, help finding things, or life hacks.
✅People prefer not to engage in conversations when asking about NSFW or sensitive subjects. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/windx0303/status/1648048897099698176))
