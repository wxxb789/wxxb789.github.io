** OpenAI just introduced Function Calling.

This is a killer feature! It's the most consequential update to their API since they released it.

Here is a #PowerShell example to show you how powerful this is: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dfinke/status/1673360490326786048))

** The question:

"What's the result of 22 plus 5 in decimal added to the hexadecimal number A?"

It's a complex question requiring adding numbers in different formats.

To solve it, we can combine functions with prompts. Here is what it looks like: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dfinke/status/1673360493464145922))

** I'm going to define two functions.

1. One that knows how to add two decimal numbers.

2. The other knows how to add two hexadecimal numbers.

You define these functions as part of the Chat Completion call:

** The implementation of these two functions is not particularly interesting.

They take the arguments and do the sum.

** This is the cool part:

I call OpenAI's API repeatedly until I find a "stop" reason.

Whenever the API finishes with a "function_call" reason, I call the specific function and pass the results back to the API.

** The output from the script:

â€¢ 22 + 5 = 27 (decimal)
â€¢ 27 + A = 31 (hexadecimal)
â€¢ The result of 22 plus 5 in decimal added to the hexadecimal number A is 31.

GPT used both of the #PowerShell functions to compute the final result! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dfinke/status/1673360522220273670))
