V1 of my prompt cheatsheet is live!

Download the json file and import it into Chatbot UI to add 20+ prompts to your code workflow.

Iâ€™ll be back soon with:
\- More complex, powerful prompts.
- A system for choosing which prompts you want to use.

This is largely a beta test to make sure that this works and to get feedback.

The realllly good prompts will start rolling in next week.

Just keep an eye on that repo for updates!

Likely going with a Mon/Thu update cadence going forward.
