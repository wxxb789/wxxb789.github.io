** Binomial distribution in Python?

We will calculate through real-life examples

** In yesterday's thread we had this question:

If the probability of a click converting to a sale is 2%, what is the probability of observing exactly 3 sales in 200 clicks?

** To calculate the answer I will use scipy.stats and the binom.pmf function:

This code will calculate the probability of observing exactly 3 sales in 200 clicks, where the probability of a click converting to a sale is 0.02.

** Now we will modify the question a bit:

If the probability of a click converting to a sale is 0.02, what is the probability of observing up to 3 sales in 200 clicks?

Now we will calculate the probability of observing 0, 1, 2, or 3 sales in 200 clicks:

** Instead of binom.pmf. we will use binom.cdf.

CDF stands for the cumulative distribution function.

** Using the binom function, you can create random samples as well.

You know the probability of a click converting to a sale is 0.02.

You want to generate a set of random samples that represent the number of people who might make a purchase after 200 clicks.

** You can use binom.rvs to create them.

In this example, we create 10 random samples:
