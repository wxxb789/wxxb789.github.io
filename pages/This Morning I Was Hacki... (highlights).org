** This morning I was hacking the new ChatGPT API and found something super interesting: there are over 80 secret plugins that can be revealed by removing a specific parameter from an API call.

The secret plugins include a "DAN plugin", "Crypto Prices Plugin", and many more.

** It is possible to use these unreleased plugins by setting up match-and-replace rules through an HTTP proxy. There are only client-side checks to validate that you have permission to use the plugins and they can be bypassed.

** The api also shows the "description_for_model" which doesn't need to be exposed to the users. It's interesting to see how the model is told to use the plugins.

** It's already fixed. Kudos @OpenAI!

And to clarify what I said earlier, it's not a client side check. The api either returns the unreviewed plugins or not. There was interesting client side behavior in regards to "installing" plugins requiring auth to install. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rez0__/status/1639318330040369185))
