🙋‍♀️How to present the same text in diff. tasks/domains as diff. embeddings W/O training?

We introduce Instructor👨‍🏫, an instruction-finetuned embedder that can generate text embeddings tailored to any task given the task instruction➡️sota on 7⃣0⃣tasks👇!

We first annotate instructions for 330 diverse tasks and train Instructor👨‍🏫 on this multitask mixture

A single Instructor👨‍🏫 model can achieve sota on 70 embedding evaluation tasks:
1⃣ Retrieval 
2⃣TextEval
3⃣Clustering
4⃣Prompt Retrieval
5⃣Classification
6⃣STS
7⃣Reranking
8⃣...

Smaller model but best performance

Instructor👨‍🏫 (335M), while having >10x fewer parameters than the previous best model (4.8B), achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average improvement of 3.4% compared to the previous best results on the 70 diverse datasets.

Instructions Enable Diverse Training

Finetuning with instructions allows Instructor👨‍🏫 to benefit from the diversity of 330 datasets, whereas simply training on those datasets alone leads to degraded performance.

Instruction-finetuning on a large amount of datasets with diverse task instructions improves the robustness of Instructor👨‍🏫 to instruction paraphrases (i.e., smaller performance gaps between best- and worst-performing instructions)

In addition, by making instruction more detailed (Left) and model size larger (Right), the performance of Instructor👨‍🏫 is consistently improved.

Instructions Mitigate Domain Shifts

Instruction-finetuned Instructor👨‍🏫 helps more on unseen domains: geography, biology and civil comments. Domain-specific datasets benefit particularly from instruction finetuning.

Led by @hongjin_su and @WeijiaShi2, joint work with @wittgen_ball , @yizhongwyz, @huyushi98, Mari, @scottyih, @nlpnoah, @LukeZettlemoyer, and @taoyds from @uwnlp, @allen_ai and @MetaAI.

Thanks @Muennighoff and @Nils_Reimers for the nice MTEB code and data. It did save our life!

Instructor👨‍🏫 embedding model is on @huggingface
 🤗: https://t.co/exB63SYxrM! 

It is very simple to use!
