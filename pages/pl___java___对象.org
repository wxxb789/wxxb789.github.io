* 对象

* There are four different ways to create a object in Java

(I really don't know is there a fifth way to do this)

1. Using =new= keyword This is the most common way to create an object
   in java. I read somewhere that almost 99% of objects are created in
   this way.

   =MyObject object = new MyObject();=

2. Using =Class.forName()= If we know the name of the class & if it has
   a public default constructor we can create an object in this way.

#+begin_src java
      // newInstance() of Class class
      MyObject object = (MyObject) Class.forName("com.path.MyObject").newInstance();
      Employee emp2 = (Employee) Class.forName("com.path.Employee").newInstance();

      // newInstance() of Constructor class
      Constructor<Employee> constructor = Employee.class.getConstructor();
      Employee emp3 = constructor.newInstance();
#+end_src

3. Using =clone()= The clone() can be used to create a copy of an
   existing object.

#+begin_src java
      MyObject anotherObject = new MyObject();
      MyObject object = anotherObject.clone();
#+end_src

4. Using *object deserialization* Object deserialization is nothing but
   creating an object from its serialized form.

#+begin_src java
      ObjectInputStream inStream = new ObjectInputStream(anInputStream );
      MyObject object = (MyObject) inStream.readObject();
#+end_src

Now you know how to create an object. But its advised to create objects
only when it is necessary to do so.
