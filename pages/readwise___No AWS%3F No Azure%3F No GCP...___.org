No AWS? No Azure? No GCP? 😥
No problem! All you need is Hugging Face! 🤗
Now, just by adding one parameter in AutoTrain, you can fine-tune custom LLMs on Hugging Face Spaces and choose GPUs like T4, A10g & even A100! 🚀🚀🚀
Your training will start in a few seconds and space will shutdown on its own after the training is done, thus saving you a lot of $$$. 🤑
