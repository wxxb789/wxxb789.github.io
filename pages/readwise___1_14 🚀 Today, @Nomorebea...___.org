3/14 🚀 Inspired by @babyAGI_ and @Auto_GPT, BlockAGI isn't just a tool—it's a self-improving entity. It evaluates its own performance and determines its next research goals to continually enhance the quality of the output.

And it gets more powerful as you give it more tools.

5/14 🤔 Why choose BlockAGI over vanilla ChatGPT?

While ChatGPT is powerful, it lacks the process to automatically evaluate and improve its results over multiple iterations. #BlockAGI makes that available while utilizing the latest @OpenAI GPT models for the best performance.
