How To Summarize a 4hr long vid into 3min reading:

20 lines of code and $.2 in cost 💸

We'll use @LangChainAI - a framework for building apps powered by language models such as 🤖ChatGPT.

Step 1 - Register OpenAI account and get API🗝️, save it into a ".env" file

Step 2 - We use the dotenv library to load the API 🗝️saved inside the .env file. 

Then we set the environment variable OPENAI API KEY. Our program now has access to chatgpt

Step 3 - Langchain has several data loaders, one of which can load youtube transcripts📜

All we need is to pass the youtube video URL to the youtubeloader

This url is a 4 hour long 😬video about the OPENAI CEO Senate hearing

loader.load() and now we can see the transcripts😼

Step 4 - There are lot of words so we can’t send all the text to chatgpt at once 🙃

We use the recursive character text splitter from langchain to chop up 🔪the text 

Now the transcript becomes 20 smaller 🦐pieces. we can send them to chatgpt one by one

Step 5 - Our goal is to summarize a 4-hr long 😴transcript into 3 min reading 😺

We use the "summarize chain" with "refine" chain type. 

Other types include "stuff", "map-reduce", "and map-rerank".

Run it & in a few mins you'll have a 3min summary!🙌
