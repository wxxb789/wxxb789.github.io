How Code Empowers LLMs

A comprehensive overview of the benefits of training LLMs with code-specific data. 

Some capabilities include enhanced code generation, enabling reasoning, function calling, automated self-improvements, and serving intelligent agents. 

This is probably one of the more important surveys that I've seen in the past few months. 

Great read to start the year as we know LLM-powered agents will be a huge emphasis this year and code understanding and generation will be core to progress.
