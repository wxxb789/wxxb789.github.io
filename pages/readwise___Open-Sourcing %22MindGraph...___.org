Open-sourcing "MindGraph", a proof of concept starter kit for building and querying against an ever-expanding knowledge graph with natural language!

\- multiple input types
- simple interface
- basic search/RAG against knowledge graph
- easily extendable with integrations
- basic database swapping

GitHub in ðŸ§µ

Quick background is that I paused on BabyAGI work after the BabyFoxAGI mod because I felt I was missing some pieces.

Went deep on knowledge graphs (KGs) and released Instagraph (https://t.co/koweUiYNCU) which lets you build, merge, and edit KGs....

Oh, and before I keep going, here's the GitHub: https://t.co/H31Y2EfKMw

This is one of my bigger projects (multiple files) which I'm not used to, so be kind plz. Hopefully still some interesting and fun patterns in here for you.

The system is designed to be easily extendable using an integration manager, which enables integrations to call each other.

Hereâ€™s how the integrations (blue) interact with each other, and call a base model.

Biggest addition from InstaGraph are the conditional_add endpoints. They:

1) search through existing graph (currently keyword but vector should be added)
2) possible matches with new entry into an LLM to decide if there is a match
3) adds the node/edge if no matches are found

Okay, just added a section in the README for how you can add and swap databases:

(I know I wrote in contributions that I don't maintain, but  don't hesitate to ping me if you want to add a database option)
