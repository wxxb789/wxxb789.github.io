** Some of the biggest companies in the world use OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and embeddings to power their AI chat apps.

Shopify, Brex, Hubspot‚Ä¶you name it.

But how do they do it? And how can you do it too?

I‚Äôll show you üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SullyOmarr/status/1635524835018444800))
** First, what are embeddings?

In super simple terms, they‚Äôre just a vector of numbers that can represent anything, such as text, music, and videos. 

In our case, it's text.

** They're important because it lets us do Semantic search.

It allows us to perform searches based on the meaning of text, rather than just exact matches. 

This makes searching much easier and more efficient. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SullyOmarr/status/1635524837295939585))
** Example:
Imagine you have a notebook with a list of wines and their descriptions, and one of them mentions that it's "good with fish,"

Then someone asks you for a recommendation, asking what is a good wine with seafood? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SullyOmarr/status/1635524838252240897))
** You look at the list, and see that this wine is good with fish, and suggest it to them because you understand that ‚Äúfish‚Äù and ‚Äúseafood‚Äù are similar.

That's a semantic search ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SullyOmarr/status/1635524839267237889))
** Embeddings are similar in that regard. 

They represent text as numbers to search for similar text based on meaning. 

They're like a map that shows how words and phrases are related to each other.

** But how do we create an AI chat app using ChatGPT and embeddings? 

The easiest way, by far, is to use @LangChainAI  or @gpt_index.

No seriously, look at how easy it is

** In their documentation they outline exactly how to do it, with only 10-15 lines of code. 

But the short explanation is: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SullyOmarr/status/1635524842551377922))
** Find some data source (pdf, webpage, text, etc) and use their python library to create indexes. 

Llama hub has a bunch of data connectors that are directly supported. So all you'd have to do is import the right one.

** From there, all you have to do is let langchain or llama index do all the hardwork:

1) Load documents
2) Create an index using the library
3) Query said index using the library

** That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôve just made (a super simple) AI chat app powered by OpenAI‚Äôs :) 

Also, this is a pretty base level explanation of the topic, and it's mostly me just trying to explain what i've learned in simple terms. 

Hope you learned something! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SullyOmarr/status/1635524845646790659))
