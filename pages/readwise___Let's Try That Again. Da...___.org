Let's try that again. Databases had different methods for atomicity and durability before WALs (such as journal mode in SQLite where it would make a copy of pages before editing them) but this post about WALs matches my intuition anyway.

In Postgres, before the WAL was introduced there were just no durability guarantees. (Granted this was 2001.)
