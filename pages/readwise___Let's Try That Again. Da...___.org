Let's try that again. Databases had different methods for atomicity and durability before WALs (such as journal mode in SQLite where it would make a copy of pages before editing them) but this post about WALs matches my intuition anyway.

And the SQLite page on WAL mode basically says the same thing, I think.

In Postgres, before the WAL was introduced there were just no durability guarantees. (Granted this was 2001.)
