âš¡ Efficient vector-caching

Embed forever, pay once.

Embedding is low-cost using OpenAIs ada text embedding, but over thousands of tokens - why pay more than once?

AnythingLLMs vector caching allows you to use the same document across workspaces and pay once.

ðŸ’Ž Persistent and Useable
Chatting and managing documents is all done from a web-browser UI.

Shut down the app and start it later - all your documents, chats, and more are still present. Picking up right where you left off.

The database is locally saved on your machine.

ðŸ”‘ Bring-Your-Own-Keys

Use your own OpenAI API key and Pinecone (free) instance and you are already on the way to managing documents with ease.

This keeps overhead low by just using what is existing, easy and accessible.
