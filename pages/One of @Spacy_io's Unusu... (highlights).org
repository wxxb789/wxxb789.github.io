** One of @spacy_io's unusual features is its strategy to embed lexical items. Instead of using standard embeddings, we use a hashing trick.
 
We wrote a technical report that benchmarks this process on various NER datasets in different scenarios (1/4)

We dub this hashing trick as the MultiHashEmbed layer. Orthographic features are hashed into a table, then the vectors are pooled into a Maxout layer to get the final embedding. (2/4)

** Our findings show that using hash embeddings is competitive with traditional embeddings in accuracy while being memory-efficient.
 
We even reduced the number of rows in MultiHashEmbed (10~20% of the usual embeddings), and observed little to no degradation in performance. (3/4)

** Here's the link again for the paper: https://t.co/Q38u0LgmUH

The hyperparameters are in the appendix as part of the config file, allowing easy reproducibility. We will also release a spaCy project for this very soon! (4/4)

** This wouldn't be possible without the help of @akos, the guidance of @OxyKodit , Adriane, & @honnibal , and our collaboration with Anders SÃ¸gaard!
