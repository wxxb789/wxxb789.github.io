** Using `fzf` with `tree` command can help you find the absolute path of a particular file. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2z81xbntzkmrsd1pbsra0w7))
** Now, if you want to copy the location of an item, you don't necessarily need to do it manually. There is a solution for that too.

First, make sure you have Xclip installed.

    sudo apt install xclip

Now pipe it to xclip like this:

    fzf | xclip \-selection clipboard

This will copy whatever lines you have pressed the enter key, on to your clipboard. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2z8bvkbg755wxd9pmts3ec7))
** •   `cat ~/.bashrc | fzf` \- Search Inside Bashrc
•   `lsblk | fzf` \- Search inside the list of lock devices
•   `ps \-aux | fzf` \- Search inside process list ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2z8c6g5h0d1z2mtj2tbafww))
** Another choice: Fzy, the Fuzzy Selector

Unlike `fzf`, `fzy` is a fuzzy selector, where you will be provided a menu to select, depending on the input. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2z7zq0p5c53tkvbm8a4rn1t))
