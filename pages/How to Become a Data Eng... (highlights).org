** Most threads hammer away about the skills you need to break into data, but being good in a technical sense is only half of the battle. 

Let's start with what you should know and discuss what you need to do after you build the right skills. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thoughtsondata/status/1609657974477279234))
** The skills you'll need and where to learn them: 

1. SQL: W3 and Mode's interactive tutorials

2. Python: Watch some FreeCodeCamp YT videos

3. Cloud: Stephane Maarek's Courses (AWS CCF > Databases > Data Analytics)

4. DB, Data Warehouses: snowflake/guides ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thoughtsondata/status/1609658226831679490))
** You can dig into some extra skill building (like airflow), but being privy to how these tools work is a good baseline.

You should try to build a project that utilizes all 4. Ask ChatGPT for project suggestions ;) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thoughtsondata/status/1609658481962885120))
** Networking: 

- Document your progress on Linkedin and Twitter

- Interact with other learners and people who already DE's

It's not guaranteed, but there are fair odds that your first job will come as a recommendation from someone you've networked with. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thoughtsondata/status/1609658984369213440))
** Job Search: 

- AWS certs will help if you don't have professional experience with it

- Message hiring recruiters and engineers of hiring companies (don't just send your resume out into the job board void)

- Share your project(s) with your network to get recommendations ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thoughtsondata/status/1609659238921502723))
** This is a very broad overview, but it should give you an idea of a solid path to becoming a data engineer this year.
