Why bother with TL in an ETL process when you can use #DLT  + @LangChainAI  functions?

No need to think about trimming your data or configuring your connectors.

I can even create a completely new dataset, and rely on @OpenAI to do it.

The @LangChainAI function wrapper helps create a food recipe out of thin air, personalised based on the user input.  
The #DLT library abstracts all configurations needed to write to storage, and stores results in any mode, append, overwrite etc.
