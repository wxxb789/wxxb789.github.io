** Do you ever need to redirect stdout with #Python?

In this mini-thread, I will show you 3Ô∏è‚É£ different methods to redirect stdout!

** 1Ô∏è‚É£ Re-assign `sys.stdout` to a file handle

In this example, you open a file and reassign `sys.stdout` to that file handle. 

Now when you call the `print()` function, it writes to a file instead of stdout!

Don't forget to revert your changes at the end!

** 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use a context manager!

Here you use `contextlib.contextmanager` to automatically redirect stdout and then revert the redirection.

This is a nice way to decorate functions that you want to write to a file without modifying all of them.

** 3Ô∏è‚É£ #Python's `contextlib` module comes with a `redirect_stdout` function context manager built-in üêçüî•

Here's how you can use it to simplify your code even further!
