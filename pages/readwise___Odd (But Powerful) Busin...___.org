#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Odd (but powerful) business context:

PCA was instrumental in analyzing the K-means results that eventually led to a $15,000,000 lead scoring algorithm that I made for my last company. 

PCA helped to visualize the K-Means similarity of RFQ (request for quotes).

Once we knew which quotes were similar, our lead scoring algorithm was able to hand-select which RFQs to work on. 

This 5X-ed our revenue over the next year. 

Shocking what impact a couple of data science algorithms can have on a business.
