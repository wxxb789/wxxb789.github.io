** I've learned so much from @hubermanlab, but podcasts make recall and discovery challenging.

Huberman AI uses the latest models from @openai to search every episode with Google-level accuracy and summarize the results.

** The search works on semantic meaning, not just keywords. This allows you to search for a term like "neurotransmitters" and get results that include "dopamine" and "serotonin."

** The "Ask" functionality does a search for your question and then answers based on the most relevant results. This way, you get Dr. Huberman's answers to your questions, not just what GPT-3 thinks.

** If you search for something that hasn't been covered on The Huberman Lab, it will say the question can't be answered instead of making something up.

** How does it work? Transcriptions are generated using Whisper and then embedded using the latest @openai text-embedding-ada-002 model.

The vectors are then stored in a @pinecone vector database. A user's query is embedded and then used to find similar vectors in the database. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rileytomasek/status/1603854653871034380))
** The "Ask" answer uses text-davinci-003 to answer the question given the search results, with instructions not to make stuff up. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rileytomasek/status/1603854656156811264))
** And the app is @remix_run hosted on @vercel. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rileytomasek/status/1603867732432281617))
