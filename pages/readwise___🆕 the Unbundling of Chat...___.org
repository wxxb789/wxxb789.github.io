ðŸ†• The Unbundling of ChatGPT  

https://t.co/6cLKLY7OwS 

A whole year has passed with ~0 growth in ChatGPT user numbers. Instead, users are exploring a whole host of verticalized players for Imagegen, Writing, Coding, Research, Agents, Voice and RAG.

[OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI) still wins in that scenario, but probably needs to release Sora and GPT-5 soon to stall mass unsubscriptions from ChatGPT.
