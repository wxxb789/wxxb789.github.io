** 2/5 With LLMs, text generation is now a focal field of study in prompt engineering. 
By providing a context for the model, we can generate specific sequences of text, such as introductory paragraphs of blog posts or creating engaging chatbot responses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CohereAI/status/1662261712987324417))
** 3/5 Another use case for LLMs is text summarization. 
Given a few examples of a full document and its summary, LLMs can condense various documents, such as customer support chats or earnings calls, providing succinct summaries that aid in comprehension. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CohereAI/status/1662261714283364363))
