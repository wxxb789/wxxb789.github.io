I have published 70 videos to my YouTube channel. 68 of them get less than 50 views/day each. ðŸ«£ 

My two long form courses on @HashiCorp Terraform and @Docker get 600+ views/day each and bring in 80% of my views.

I realized Iâ€™m good at long form educational videos and not so good at catchy short form videos. These types of courses also have much greater longevity as viewers continue to search for those topics.

Figure out your strengths and leverage them! ðŸš€
