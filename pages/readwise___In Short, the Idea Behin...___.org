In short, the idea behind this gzip + kNN approach is that a given text A is close to the size of two concatenated texts A + B when compressed using Gzip. 

Or, the compressed size of A+A is similar to the compressed size of just A (plus a constant value for the back reference) https://t.co/Zb94wToLBx
