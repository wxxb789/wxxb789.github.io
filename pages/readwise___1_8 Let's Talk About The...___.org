2/8 Amdahl's Law, named after Gene Amdahl, is a cornerstone in understanding the limits of concurrency. It tells us that the speedup gained from parallelization is directly limited by the fraction of sequential code in the program.

3/8 In simpler terms, no matter how many threads or processors you use, the sequential part of your code sets an upper bound on how fast your program can run. It's like having a bottleneck that slows everything down.

4/8 Think of going to the mall: many shoppers can browse simultaneously, but when it's time to pay, lines form as there are fewer cashiers. Just like in a concurrent system, speed is limited by sequential segments.
