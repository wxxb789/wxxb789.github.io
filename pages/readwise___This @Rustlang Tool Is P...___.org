This @rustlang tool is part of my work @GoogleHealth’s genomics team (hosts: @daniel_e_cook and @belyaeva_ana). We use it for evaluating DeepConsensus, though it should be generally useful for evaluating basecalling or other sequencing methods

There are many tools for quality control of sequencing data, but many of them are not suitable for evaluating sequencing accuracy when a “truth” reference assembly is available. This tool takes in aligned reads and computes many metrics like yield, homopolymer accuracy, etc.

It outputs csv files that are easily usable for downstream analysis, comparison of techniques, plotting, etc.

Finally, I think it’s got the best name 😎 (best stands for Bam Error Stats Tool)

For a bit of background, DeepConsensus (by the genomics team @Google) is a transformer model for error correction in @PacBio’s circular consensus sequencing. It is used in the Revio sequencing machine: https://t.co/0KmkmMUALf

Here’s an example of DeepConsensus metrics that partially use best: https://t.co/ptHP8Q2QO6
