15 Ways to Tidy Your Code

I recently finished the book "Tidy First" by <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck">@KentBeck</a> . It's an absolute masterpiece, and I strongly recommend it to others.

In the first part, it provides 15 ways to tidy your code.
1. Guard Clauses
2. Dead Code
3. Normalize Symmetries
4. New Interface, Old Implementation
5. Reading Order
6. Cohesion Order
7. Move Declaration and Initialization Together
8. Explaining Variables
9. Explaining Constants
10. Explicit Parameters
11. Chunk Statements
12. Extract Helper
13. One Pile
14. Explaining Comments
15. Delete Redundant Comments

In the second and third parts, it delves deeply into the tidying process and theory.

It's a short book, and I read it cover to cover, taking only about 2 hours (bonus).
