ðŸ§± OpenAI Functions + Structured Data ðŸ§±

We've released new @LangChainAI chains using OpenAI functions to reliably output data matching a schema!

They're great for pipelines & workflows beyond chat.

When OpenAI released function calling, a clear (and very hype!) application was to use them to power tools for agents. 

But they also added a way for you to choose a specific function and force the chat model to return arguments for it!

This new chain takes advantage of this by defining a "function" that takes arguments exactly matching the schema we want. 

While we don't necessarily intend to use those arguments to call something else, the response will conveniently match the output schema we want.

This is easier and cleaner than adding output formatting instructions into your prompt, and stays reliable with higher temperature values, allowing for more varied generative results.

You can use these chains on their own or as a step in a larger pipeline.

And finally, functions models and the APIs around them are still very new, so stay tuned and let us know if there's anything else you'd like to see!

Thanks for reading!
