** 📍🧵🚨 QA on plots & charts is a complex task requiring sophisticated reasoning - our visual language models struggle with this.

LLMs are super strong reasoners - but they only work for text.

What do we do? We translate plots & charts to text so LLM can understand!

** We propose DePlot📊, one-shot visual language reasoning by (1) translating a plot image to a linearized table and then (2) using LLMs to answer QA queries via prompting techniques such as chain of thought and self-consistency (other table reasoning methods should work as well).

** On ChartQA human queries, DePlot+LLM outperforms SOTA (fine-tuned with >28k data points) by 24.0% with just one-shot supervision! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/hardy_qr/status/1605480024772988928))
** DePlot can do cool things, like, given a screenshot of the figure from your paper, telling you by how much your approach beats the second strongest model on average, step by step 😊 (see example in the pic).
