Quartz is designed first and foremost as a tool for publishing digital gardens to the web. To me, digital gardening is not just passive knowledge collection. Itâ€™s a form of expression and sharing.

I wasnâ€™t happy with how difficult Quartz 3 was to setup -- especially for non-developers -- so I set out to make something easy to use enough for non-technical people to get going but also powerful enough that senior developers can tweak it to work how theyâ€™d like it to work.

Quartz 4 basically scraps all of the code and starts from scratch. Instead of Hugo, it now uses Node.js under the hood which JSX support which should lead to a much more helpful error messages and an overall smoother user experience.

The core insight of Quartz 4 is that static site generation can be though of as a map-filter-reduce over Markdown files. This was the base for a really powerful abstraction of the three types of plugins:
1. Transformers (transform files)
2. Filters
3. Emitters (produce new files)

As a result, I was able to create an extensible configuration and plugin system for Quartz. It's fully type-safe and designed to be extended by users while making updating to new versions of super easy.

I won't dive too deep into the technical weeds here but if you _do_ care about that stuff, check out the architecture page for more details:

Lastly, this work is the culmination of almost 3 months of coding which totals just under 7000 lines. I'm really grateful to the Quartz community and my GitHub sponsors for the continued support. It's been a great two years and I can't wait to see what else lies ahead :)
