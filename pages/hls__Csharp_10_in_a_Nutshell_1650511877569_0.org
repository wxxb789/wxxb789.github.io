* However, with C# generics, producer types (i.e., opentypes such as List<T>) can be compiled into a library (such as mscorlib.dll). is works because thesynthesis between the producer and the consumer that produces closed types doesn’t actually happenuntil runtime. With C++ templates, this synthesis is performed at compile time. is means that inC++ you don’t deploy template libraries as .dlls—they exist only as source code. It also makes itdifficult to dynamically inspect, let alone create, parameterized types on the fly.
