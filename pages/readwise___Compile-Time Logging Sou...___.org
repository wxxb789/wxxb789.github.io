Compile-time logging source generation - 

\- for highly performant logging. ðŸ‘‡ 

In the world of .NET software development,Â loggingÂ is a crucial part of keeping track of what's happening inside your applications. 

Imagine you're writing code and you want to log something. 

Instead of writing a bunch of code to set up the logging, you just add this attribute to aÂ partial method, and LoggerMessageAttribute does the heavy lifting for you. 

It's like having a personal assistant for your logging tasks!

It helps you find and fix issues, understand how your software is behaving, and ensure it runs smoothly.
 
With the release of .NET 6, there's a new tool in town calledÂ LoggerMessageAttribute, and it's here to make logging better and easier.

I explained how to implement it in my blog post.
