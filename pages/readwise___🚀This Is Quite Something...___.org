🚀This is quite something - web scraping with LLM🚀

👉 @AnthropicAI + @LangChainAI

💡1) Ask Langchain Agent to scrape data

💡2) Get back data in a list

And the magical thing is with 100k context window of @AnthropicAI, you dont need to use vectordb as well here.

➡️ PlayWright Browser Toolkit

This toolkit is used to interact with the browser. While other tools (like the Requests tools) are fine for static sites, Browser toolkits let your agent navigate the web and interact with dynamically rendered sites.

```py
!pip install playwright > /dev/null
!pip install  lxml

```
If this is your first time using playwright, you'll have to install a browser executable.

Running `playwright install` by default installs a chromium browser executable.

📌 Several of the browser tools are StructuredTool's, meaning they expect multiple arguments. These aren't compatible (out of the box) with agents older than the `STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`

---------------

➡️ `AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`

This structured tool chat agent is capable of using multi-input tools.

Older agents are configured to specify an action input as a single string, but this agent can use the provided tools' `args_schema` to populate the action input.

💡Now What is a “Structured Tool”?

A structured tool represents an action an agent can take. It wraps any function you provide to let an agent easily interface with it. A Structured Tool object is defined by its:

👉 name: a label telling the agent which tool to pick. For example, a tool named "GetCurrentWeather" tells the agent that it's for finding the current weather.

👉 description: a short instruction manual that explains when and why the agent should use the tool.

👉 args_schema: Communicates the interface of the tool for the agent. It typically draws from the wrapped function's signature and permits additional validation logic on tool inputs.

👉 _run and _arun functions: These define the tool's inner workings. It could be something simple like returning the current time or more complex like sending a message or controlling a robot.
