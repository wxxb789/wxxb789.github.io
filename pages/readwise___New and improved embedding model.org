**Unification of capabilities**. We have significantly simplified the interface of theÂ [/embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)Â endpoint by merging the five separate models shown above (`text-similarity`,Â `text-search-query`,Â `text-search-doc`,Â `code-search-text`Â andÂ `code-search-code`) into a single new model. This single representation performs better than our previous embedding models across a diverse set of text search, sentence similarity, and code searchÂ benchmarks.
